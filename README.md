**`Aspiring Java Developer`**

Hi, I am Elia Ashraf. I am a masters student in computer science. I follow a bunch of tutorials from YouTube or certain websites, which I link in my projects when uploading them on GitHub. I am learning to be a software developer one step at a time. For now I am learning Spring and its build tool Maven to gain some hands-on experience in Java EE. I constantly try to make my GitHub more fascinating. Thank you for stopping by and checking out my GitHub profile.

  My dad is a software developer and seeing him work using languages that looked like maths and made no sense to me as a kid had fascinated me for a long while. That's when I decided I wanted to study computer science when I grew up. Throughout my education in computer science, I had tried my hands at multiple fields from machine learning to full stack development to web development. Initially, during my bachelors I had tried working on a few projects using HTML/CSS and PHP, but somehow I did not enjoy it very much. 
  Then I moved to Germany for my masters course. I had taken up a couple of courses on machine learning and AI during the initial semesters of my masters program at the University of Siegen. During COVID-19, I also tried my hands at MEAN/MERN stack, though I was quite enjoying the experience of both the full stack development and machine learning I started missing programming with Java.
  I had first learned the data structures and prograaming in Java during my bachelors. So I started working my way back into Java, although right after I dived into it I could feel that I have forgotten many syntaxes and functions in Java. But it felt good, I felt like being at home working with Java. This was when I decided that I wanted to be a Java developer.
  
  Thank you for reading my joruney to programming, specifically in Java. My portfolio has been inspired by Forrest Knight's <a href="https://github.com/forrestknight">github</a> page.
